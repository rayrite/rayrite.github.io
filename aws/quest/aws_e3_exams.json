Answers to Chapter Review CHAPTER 1. CLOUD COMPUTING 1. A. High Availability, Elasticity, and Agility High Availability ensures that the social media application remains accessible to users at all times, minimizing downtime and maintaining a seamless user experience. Elasticity allows the application to automatically scale resources up or down based on the current traffic load, handling traffic surges efficiently without manual intervention. Agility enables the startup to quickly deploy new features and updates, allowing them to respond rapidly to user feedback and market demands, keeping their application competitive. These features collectively provide a comprehensive solution for managing variable workloads, ensuring continuous availability, and supporting rapid development and deployment, which are critical for the startup's success. 2. C. AWS enables the startup to benefit from its massive infrastructure and customer base, resulting in lower costs due to bulk purchasing and efficient resource utilization. Economies of Scale refers to the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation, with cost per unit of output generally decreasing with increasing scale as fixed costs are spread out over more units of output. AWS’s massive infrastructure and large customer base allow it to negotiate lower prices for hardware, bandwidth, and other resources, which it can then pass on as cost savings to its customers. This bulk purchasing power and efficient resource utilization enable AWS to offer lower costs compared to what individual companies might achieve with their smaller-scale operations. Options A, B, and D focus on different aspects of AWS cost management and flexibility but do not specifically illustrate economies of scale, which is achieved through the large-scale operation and resource optimization AWS can provide. 3. C. Hybrid A Hybrid deployment model combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud services. This approach allows the financial services company to meet regulatory compliance and data sovereignty requirements by keeping sensitive data on-premises, while still benefiting from the scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency of the cloud for non-sensitive applications and workloads. This model offers the best of both worlds, ensuring sensitive data remains secure and compliant, while enabling the company to innovate and scale using cloud resources. 4. B. The capability to scale compute resources up or down automatically based on demand. Elasticity features of cloud computing refers to the ability to dynamically scale compute resources up or down based on the current demand. This means that additional resources can be provisioned automatically during peak usage times to handle the increased load. During periods of low usage, resources can be scaled down to reduce costs. This dynamic adjustment of resources helps ensure optimal performance and cost efficiency, making it a key advantage of cloud computing. 5. D. Rapid provisioning of resources One of the main advantages of cloud computing that contributes to business agility is the rapid provisioning of resources. This rapid provisioning of resources allows businesses to quickly deploy and scale applications as needed without the delays associated with traditional IT infrastructure procurement and setup. This feature of cloud computing enables companies to respond faster to market changes, innovate more quickly, and efficiently handle varying workloads, thus providing a competitive edge. 6. C. Hybrid Cloud A Hybrid Cloud deployment model combines on-premises infrastructure or a private cloud with public cloud services. This model allows data and applications to be shared between on-premises and the cloud, providing greater flexibility and deployment options. Hybrid Cloud enables organizations to scale their on-premises infrastructure to the public cloud to handle additional resource demand, integrate and migrate workloads seamlessly, and manage security and compliance requirements more effectively. 7. C. A deployment model that combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud resources, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. A hybrid deployment model in cloud computing integrates on-premises infrastructure with cloud resources. This model enables organizations to utilize the benefits of both environments, enabling them to maintain sensitive data and critical applications on-premises while taking advantage of the scalability and flexibility of the cloud for other workloads. This approach provides greater flexibility, cost optimization, and improved disaster recovery options compared to using only on-premises or solely cloud-based deployments. 8. B. Provides scalable resources on demand The cloud deployment model is characterized by its ability to provide scalable resources on demand. This means that resources such as computing power, storage, and networking can be adjusted based on the user's needs, allowing for greater flexibility and efficiency. This scalability is a fundamental benefit of cloud computing, enabling businesses to handle varying workloads without significant upfront investment in physical hardware. In contrast, on-premises models (Option A) require substantial initial capital investment (Option D) and typically offer limited scalability compared to cloud solutions. Cloud services often feature extensive network access (Option C) rather than limited access. CHAPTER 2. CLOUD ECONOMICS 1. A. AWS replaces fixed costs with variable costs, allowing the startup to pay only for what they use and scale expenses with demand. In an on-premises infrastructure, companies incur significant fixed costs for hardware, cooling, physical security, and other infrastructure maintenance. These costs remain constant regardless of the actual usage of the resources. When moving to AWS, these fixed costs are replaced by variable costs, meaning the company only pays for the resources they consume. This model allows the startup to scale its expenses with demand, providing financial flexibility and often leading to cost savings, especially for fluctuating workloads. By leveraging AWS's pay-as-you-go pricing, the startup can better manage its finances and avoid the high upfront costs associated with on-premises infrastructure. 2. A. Server hardware, electricity, and network security When maintaining an on-premises environment, several costs need to be considered: • Server hardware: This includes the initial purchase cost of servers, regular upgrades, and replacements. • Electricity: This encompasses the power required to run servers and the cooling systems to maintain optimal operating temperatures. • Network security: This involves the cost of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other security measures to protect the data center. These costs are substantial and ongoing, unlike the pay-as-you-go pricing model of cloud services, where you only pay for what you use. This makes the comparison critical in highlighting the potential savings and operational efficiencies achievable by migrating to AWS. 3. B. Apply the Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model for the existing licenses and use included licenses for new software requirements. • Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model: This allows you to leverage existing software licenses that you already own, potentially reducing costs as you do not need to repurchase licenses. This strategy ensures compliance with the licensing agreements you have in place. • Included licenses: For new software requirements, using included licenses can simplify the procurement and management process, ensuring that you have the necessary licenses without the need to manage them separately. This combination of strategies enables you to optimize costs by utilizing your existing investments in software licenses while ensuring compliance and ease of management for new software applications. 4. B. Rightsizing the EC2 instances to better match the workload requirements Rightsizing involves analyzing the performance and utilization metrics of your existing EC2 instances and then adjusting the instance types or sizes to better match the actual workload requirements. This can significantly reduce costs by ensuring you are not over-provisioning resources, which leads to underutilization and higher expenses. By selecting the appropriate instance type and size, you can optimize cost while maintaining the required performance levels. Implementing Auto Scaling (option A) helps with dynamic adjustment of resources but does not specifically address underutilization of existing resources. Moving to Reserved Instances (option C) can save costs but does not address the issue of underutilization. Enabling Multi-AZ deployment (option D) improves availability but does not optimize resource usage and costs. 5. C. AWS CloudFormation AWS CloudFormation is designed to automate the provisioning and configuration management of AWS resources. It allows you to define your infrastructure as code using JSON or YAML templates. This ensures that your infrastructure is deployed consistently across multiple regions and environments. By using CloudFormation, you can easily replicate environments, reduce manual configuration errors, and save time by automating repetitive tasks. This makes it the ideal choice for a small team that needs to manage a consistent infrastructure efficiently. 6. C. Amazon RDS and Amazon EKS • Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a fully managed relational database service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It is ideal for applications that require a relational database for transactional purposes and real-time analytics. • Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to manage the Kubernetes control plane. It is perfect for managing microservices deployments, providing scalability, and ensuring efficient orchestration of containerized applications. Together, Amazon RDS and Amazon EKS offer a robust solution for handling relational data with real-time analytics and managing microservices efficiently, meeting the startup's requirements. CHAPTER 3. AWS INTRODUCTION 1. C. Programmatic Access (APIs, SDKs, CLI) and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) • Programmatic Access (APIs, SDKs, CLI) provides the development team with the ability to automate tasks, integrate AWS services with other systems, and write custom scripts to manage infrastructure. This allows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices, which are essential for frequent feature updates. • Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ensures that the infrastructure can be defined, managed, and provisioned using code. This approach provides consistency, repeatability, and version control for the infrastructure, making it easier to manage and automate. IaC tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation are ideal for maintaining the infrastructure in a scalable and efficient manner. Combining these methods allows the startup to automate deployments, ensure consistent environments, and efficiently manage infrastructure changes, meeting the needs of both the development and operations teams. 2. B. Use AWS CloudFormation to create a template for deploying and terminating resources. AWS CloudFormation allows you to define your infrastructure as code, creating templates that can be reused for deploying and terminating resources. This approach ensures repeatability and reduces manual effort, as you can deploy the entire infrastructure setup with a single command. Using CloudFormation templates is cost-efficient and minimizes the risk of errors associated with manual deployment and termination. In this scenario, the temporary nature of the resources and the need for repeatable processes make CloudFormation an ideal choice. It allows the startup to automate the deployment and termination of resources efficiently, supporting their campaign needs effectively. CHAPTER 4. AWS COST & BILLING MANAGEMENT 1. A. AWS Budgets, AWS Cost Explorer, and AWS Billing Conductor • AWS Budgets allows you to set custom cost and usage budgets.
