  "question": "A company wants its Amazon EC2 instances to operate in a highly available environment, even if there is a natural disaster in a particular geographic area. Which solution achieves this goal?",
  "options": [
    "Use EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone",
    "Use EC2 instances in multiple AWS Regions",
    "Use EC2 instances in multiple edge locations.",
    "Use Amazon CloudFront with the EC2 instances configured as the source."
  ],
  "explanation": "Using EC2 instances in multiple AWS Regions ensures high availability even in the event of a natural disaster in a particular geographic area. If one region goes down due to a disaster, the instances in other regions will continue to function normally, providing uninterrupted service to customers. This solution provides a higher level of fault tolerance and disaster recovery capability, as compared to using EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone or multiple edge locations. www. shapingpixel.com",

  "explanation": "Practicing infrastructure as code means applying the same rigor of application code development to infrastructure provisioning. All configurations should be defined in a declarative way and stored in a source control system such as AWS CodeCommit, the same as application code. Infrastructure provisioning, orchestration, and deployment should also support the use of the infrastructure as code. www. shapingpixel.com",
