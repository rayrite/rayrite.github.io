For example, if you're going to try Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), it might help if you know what kind of operating system you need, what your memory requirements are, and how much I/O you need. You should aiso decide whether you need storage, such as if you're going to run a database and how long you intend to use the servers. You don't need to make these decisions before generating an estimate, though.

Testing is not typically used to validate recovery strategies. In the cloud, you can test how your workload fails, and you can validate your recovery procedures.
