When running on-premises infrastructure, companies must\nmake significant upfront capital investments (CapEx) in hardware,\nfacilities, and infrastructure, followed by ongoing costs for\nmaintenance, upgrades, and operations. In contrast, AWS Cloud\nfollows a pay-as-you-go model, where most costs are operational\nexpenditures (OpEx) that vary based on actual resource usage. This\neliminates the need for large upfront investments and allows\norganizations to align their IT costs with actual business needs. The\nAWS pricing model charges customers only for the resources they\nconsume, with the flexibility to scale up or down as needed. This\ntransformation from CapEx to OpEx is one of the key financial benefits\nof cloud adoption, enabling better cash flow management and reduced\nfinancial risk.\n  Expenditure           On-Premises                AWS Cloud\n  Type                  Infrastructure             Infrastructure\n  Capital\n                        High upfront costs for\n  Expenditure                                      Minimal to none\n                        hardware, facilities\n  (CapEx)\n  Operational\n                        Fixed costs for            Variable costs\n  Expenditure\n                        maintenance, staff         based on usage\n  (OpEx)\n  Infrastructure        Requires new CapEx         Pay-as-you-go,\n  Scaling               investment                 elastic scaling\n                        Higher due to large        Lower due to no\n  Financial Risk\n                        upfront investment         upfront costs\n                        May have unused            Matches actual\n  Cost Alignment\n                        capacity                   resource usage\n\f                                        Flexible,\n                  Long-term financial\nBudget Planning                         consumption-\n                  commitments\n                                        based\n\fEND",
