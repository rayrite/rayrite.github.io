      "Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)",
      "Amazon DynamoDB Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)",

    "correct_answers": [],
    "explanation": "figuration and setup are required to achieve high availability. Here's a comparison of availability characteristics for these services: Service Default Multi- AZ Support Durability SLA Additional Configuration Required Amazon S3 Yes 99.999999999% No DynamoDB Yes 99.999999999% No Amazon EBS No 99.999% Yes Amazon EC2 No Varies Yes Amazon EFS No 99.999999999% Yes The key difference lies in the architectural design of these services. S3 and DynamoDB are fully managed services that handle replication and high availability automatically, while EBS, EC2, and EFS require explicit configuration and management decisions to achieve high availability across multiple AZs|",
