Setting the group size (also known as the desired capacity) or minimum group size to 5 would increase the number of instances to 5 but would not stop Auto Scaling from subsequently adding more instances. Deleting the target tracking policy would not necessarily prevent the number of instances in the group from growing, as another process such as a scheduled scaling policy could add more instances to the group. 264 Appendix A ■ Answers to Review Questions",
