      "AWS Direct Connect"
    ],
    "explanation": "AWS Direct Connect is a network service that allows organizations to\nestablish a dedicated private network connection between their on-premises\ninfrastructure and AWS. This direct connection helps ensure the\nconfidentiality and security of data in transit by bypassing the public internet,\nwhich reduces the risk of data interception. Additionally, while Direct\nConnect itself does not encrypt data, encryption can be added through the use\nof protocols like IPsec VPN over the Direct Connect link to enhance security.\n<br><br><b>Incorrect Options:</b>\n<br>B. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration: Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a\nservice that speeds up uploads and downloads to and from Amazon S3 using\nAmazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. While it enhances\nthe performance of data transfers, it does not inherently provide encryption\nfor data in transit between on-premises servers and AWS.\n<br>C. Amazon CloudFront: Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network\n(CDN) that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to users\nglobally with low latency. It can encrypt data during transmission to endusers but is not designed for encrypting data specifically in transit between\non-premises servers and AWS.\n<br>D. AWS Key Management Service (KMS): AWS Key Management Service\n(KMS) is a service that allows you to create and control encryption keys used\nto encrypt data at rest in various AWS services. KMS itself does not encrypt\ndata in transit; it is used for managing encryption keys rather than providing\nsecure communication channels.",
