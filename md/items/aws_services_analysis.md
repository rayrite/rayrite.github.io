#### Auto Scaling

**Mentions**: 9

**Context 1:**

- **Use Case**: we can use an auto scaling group  So why
- **Extended Context**: Okay, so now new have an application that can be load balanced through a load balancer, but how do we create, automatically these servers in the back end  For this we can use an auto scaling group  So why...

**Context 2:**
- **Mention**: So in the cloud we know we can create and get rid of servers very quickly and so the goal of an auto scaling group is to scale out
- **Use Case**: to scale out  That means add EC2 instances to match an increased load or scale in, that means remove EC2 instances to match a decreased load
- **Technical Details**: 2 instances
- **Extended Context**: So you expect more load during the day and less load during the night  So in the cloud we know we can create and get rid of servers very quickly and so the goal of an auto scaling group is to scale out  That means add EC2 instances to match an increased load or scale in, that means remove EC2 instan...

**Context 3:**
- **Mention**: With this we can ensure that we have, also as well, a minimum, and a maximum number of machines running at any point of time and once the auto scaling group does create, or remove EC2 instances we can make sure that these instances will be registered, or de registered into our load balancer
- **Use Case**: we can ensure that we have, also as well, a minimum, and a maximum number of machines running at any point of time and once the auto scaling group does create, or remove EC2 instances we can make sure that these instances will be registered, or de registered into our load balancer  So these two things work hand in hand

**Context 14:**
- **Mention**: So one question that's common is what is the difference between CloudFront and something like S3 Replication
- **Use Case**: what is the difference between CloudFront and something like S3 Replication  Well, if you have CloudFront, you're using the Global Edge network, so this is about 216 points of presence, and the files are going to be cached in each edge location, maybe for a day
- **Extended Context**: So using CloudFront and the edge locations, we can see that the content of our S3 bucket in one region can be distributed all around the world through the edge locations or points of presence  So one question that's common is what is the difference between CloudFront and something like S3 Replicatio...

**Context 15:**
- **Mention**: S3 Cross-Region Replication is different, it must be set up for each region you want replication to happen, so this is not for every region in the world
- **Use Case**: is amazing if you have static content that must be able to be available everywhere around the world  S3 Cross-Region Replication is different, it must be set up for each region you want replication to happen, so this is not for every region in the world  And then files are going to be updated in near real-time, so there's no caching that happens

**Context 16:**
- **Mention**: So they serve very different purposes, CloudFront is a CDN, which is to cache content all around the world, whereas S3 Cross-Region Replication is to really replicate an entire bucket into another region
- **Use Case**: only for read only, and so this is great if you have dynamic content that needs to change all the time and be available at low-latency in a few regions  So they serve very different purposes, CloudFront is a CDN, which is to cache content all around the world, whereas S3 Cross-Region Replication is to really replicate an entire bucket into another region  So hopefully that makes sense about CloudFront

**Context 1:**
- **Mention**: So DDoS is a sort of attack where all your servers around the world are getting attacked at the same time, we'll see this later on in this course, and the idea is that CloudFront because your application is worldwide, then you're protected against these attacks, also using something called Shield and Web Application Firewall, that we will be seeing in the security section
- **Use Case**: a sort of attack where all your servers around the world are getting attacked at the same time, we'll see this later on in this course, and the idea is that CloudFront because your application is worldwide, then you're protected against these attacks, also using something called Shield and Web Application Firewall, that we will be seeing in the security section  So if we wanted to look at a map of the world, these are the map and we see some edge locations as well at edge caches
- **Extended Context**: On top of it, by having the content distributed globally we are getting DDoS protection  So DDoS is a sort of attack where all your servers around the world are getting attacked at the same time, we'll see this later on in this course, and the idea is that CloudFront because your application is worl...

**Context 4:**
- **Mention**: Very, very simple, but that's how SQS works at a high level
- **Use Case**: that it will read the messages and this is the application you would have to code obviously and then when the message processing is done, you would click on the messages and then delete them to remove them from the queue and as you can see, messages available is zero  Very, very simple, but that's how SQS works at a high level  Now, if you go back to your queues, you will get a list of all your queues and to finish this hands on, you can go ahead and delete this queue
- **Extended Context**: If there were say, if there were some sets, but what the application will do is that it will read the messages and this is the application you would have to code obviously and then when the message processing is done, you would click on the messages and then delete them to remove them from the queue...

**AWS Services mentioned (6):**

#### Auto Scaling

**Mentions**: 2

**Context 1:**
- **Mention**: Instead, you should use auto scaling and scale the based on what the actual demand on your system is going to be
- **Use Case**: going to be  You should also test your system at production scale
- **Extended Context**: So in the cloud, when you want to have a good architecture you need to stop guessing your capacity needs  Instead, you should use auto scaling and scale the based on what the actual demand on your system is going to be  You should also test your system at production scale...

**Context 2:**
- **Mention**: So these are guided by the principles of serverless, infrastructure as a service, auto scaling and so on
- **Extended Context**: Automation  So these are guided by the principles of serverless, infrastructure as a service, auto scaling and so on  Loose coupling, which is very important...

#### CloudFormation

**Mentions**: 1

**Context 1:**
- **Mention**: So for this CloudFormation is very important because if you get infrastructure as code then you can easily create an architecture on different accounts and different regions
- **Use Case**: CloudFormation is very important because if you get infrastructure as code then you can easily create an architecture on different accounts and different regions  Also using platform as a service, such as Beanstalk could be very helpful to experiment quickly
- **Extended Context**: Now, it's also very important to automate to make architectural experimentation easier  So for this CloudFormation is very important because if you get infrastructure as code then you can easily create an architecture on different accounts and different regions  Also using platform as a service, suc...
