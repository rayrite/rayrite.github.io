##  **IMMEDIATE CRISIS RESPONSE OBJECTIVES**

### ** Decision Time - What's your FIRST priority?**

You have multiple critical alerts simultaneously. In a healthcare security breach, what should you prioritize?

**Option A:** Immediately shut down all AWS resources to stop the attack
**Option B:** Investigate the scope of data compromise first
**Option C:** Notify patients and HIPAA regulators immediately
**Option D:** Isolate affected systems while preserving evidence

<details>
<summary><strong> Click to see the correct crisis response priority</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer: Option D - Isolate while preserving evidence**

**Why this is the right approach:**
- **Contain the threat** without destroying forensic evidence
- **Maintain patient care** - can't shut down critical healthcare systems
- **Legal protection** - preservation of evidence is crucial for investigation
- **Regulatory compliance** - HIPAA requires specific incident response procedures

**Immediate Action Plan (First 30 minutes):**
1. **Isolate affected instances** - Move to isolated subnet, don't terminate
2. **Preserve evidence** - Take EBS snapshots before any changes
3. **Activate incident response team** - Security, legal, compliance, communications
4. **Assess patient safety impact** - Ensure critical systems remain operational
5. **Begin forensic collection** - Start gathering logs and evidence

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **Option A:** Could destroy evidence and disrupt patient care
- **Option B:** Breach is ongoing - must contain first
- **Option C:** Need to understand scope before notifications (24-72 hour window)
</details>

##  **STEP 1: ATTACK INVESTIGATION & ANALYSIS**

Your security team has isolated the affected systems. Now you need to understand what happened using AWS security services.

### **GuardDuty Findings Analysis:**### **GuardDuty Analysis Results:**
- **CryptoCurrency:EC2/BitcoinTool.B!DNS** - 15 EC2 instances are querying domains associated with cryptocurrency mining
- **UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/TorClient** - Traffic routed through Tor network for anonymity
- **Trojan:EC2/BlackholeTraffic** - Instances communicating with known malware C&C servers
- **Impact:EC2/MaliciousCommand** - Suspicious commands executed on compromised instances

### **CloudTrail Log Analysis:**
- **Unusual API calls** from IP addresses in Eastern Europe (Russia, Romania)
- **AssumeRole** calls using compromised IAM credentials 
- **GetObject** calls accessing patient data buckets at 3:30 AM EST
- **CreateUser** and **AttachUserPolicy** - New admin users created

### ** Decision Time - What was the likely attack vector?**

Based on the evidence, how did the attackers gain initial access?

**Option A:** SQL injection attack on the web application
**Option B:** Compromised IAM credentials (access keys exposed)
**Option C:** Phishing attack on employee accounts
**Option D:** Unpatched vulnerability in EC2 instances

<details>
<summary><strong> Click to see the attack vector analysis</strong></summary>

**Most Likely: Option B - Compromised IAM credentials**

**Evidence supporting this theory:**
- **AssumeRole calls** from foreign IP addresses suggest credential hijacking
- **Immediate admin access** rather than privilege escalation pattern
- **Cryptocurrency mining** deployed rapidly across multiple instances
- **No evidence of web app exploitation** in CloudTrail logs

**How it likely happened:**
1. **Developer accidentally committed** AWS access keys to public GitHub repository
2. **Automated scanners** found and harvested the credentials within hours
3. **Attackers tested access** and found overly permissive EC2 permissions
4. **Deployed mining software** to generate revenue from stolen compute
5. **Accessed S3 buckets** containing patient data for potential sale/ransom

**Key lesson:** This is why AWS recommends never using long-term access keys and always using IAM roles with temporary credentials.
