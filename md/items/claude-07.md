**Implementation Strategy:**

**1. Product Search Implementation:**
```javascript
// OpenSearch Product Search
async function searchProducts(query, filters, page = 1) {
    const searchBody = {
        query: {
            bool: {
                must: [
                    {
                        multi_match: {
                            query: query,
                            fields: ["title^3", "description", "tags^2"],
                            fuzziness: "AUTO",
                            operator: "and"
                        }
                    }
                ],
                filter: buildFilters(filters) // price range, category, rating, etc.
            }
        },
        aggs: {
            categories: { terms: { field: "category" } },
            price_ranges: { 
                range: {
                    field: "price",
                    ranges: [
                        { to: 25 },
                        { from: 25, to: 50 },
                        { from: 50, to: 100 },
                        { from: 100 }
                    ]
                }
            },
            brands: { terms: { field: "brand" } }
        },
        sort: [
            { _score: { order: "desc" } },
            { rating: { order: "desc" } }
        ],
        from: (page - 1) * 20,
        size: 20
    };
    
    return await opensearchClient.search({
        index: 'products',
        body: searchBody
    });
}
```

**2. User Reviews with DynamoDB:**
```javascript
// Store flexible review data
async function createReview(productId, userId, reviewData) {
    const review = {
        product_id: productId,
        user_id: userId,
        rating: reviewData.rating,
        review_text: reviewData.text,
        review_date: new Date().toISOString(),
        helpful_votes: 0,
        verified_purchase: reviewData.verifiedPurchase,
        images: reviewData.images || [],
        // Flexible attributes - can add new fields without schema changes
        ...(reviewData.pros && { pros: reviewData.pros }),
        ...(reviewData.cons && { cons: reviewData.cons }),
        ...(reviewData.recommendation && { would_recommend: reviewData.recommendation })
    };
    
    return await dynamoDBClient.put({
        TableName: 'user-reviews',
        Item: review
    }).promise();
}

// Query reviews with pagination
async function getProductReviews(productId, lastEvaluatedKey) {
    return await dynamoDBClient.query({
        TableName: 'user-reviews',
        KeyConditionExpression: 'product_id = :pid',
        ExpressionAttributeValues: {
            ':pid': productId
        },
        ScanIndexForward: false, // newest first
        Limit: 20,
        ExclusiveStartKey: lastEvaluatedKey
    }).promise();
}
```

**3. Recommendation System:**
```javascript
// Track user behavior for recommendations
async function trackUserBehavior(userId, action, productId, sessionId) {
    const behaviorItem = {
        user_id: userId,
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        action: action, // "view", "add_to_cart", "purchase"
        product_id: productId,
        session_id: sessionId
    };
    
    await dynamoDBClient.put({
        TableName: 'user-behavior',
        Item: behaviorItem
    }).promise();
    
    // Update product associations asynchronously
    await updateProductAssociations(userId, action, productId);
}

// Get personalized recommendations
async function getRecommendations(userId, productId) {
    // Get products frequently bought together
    const associations = await dynamoDBClient.query({
        TableName: 'product-associations',
        KeyConditionExpression: 'product_id = :pid',
        ExpressionAttributeValues: {
            ':pid': productId
        },
        ScanIndexForward: false,
        Limit: 10
    }).promise();
    
    return associations.Items;
}
```
