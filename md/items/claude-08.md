## Exam Strategy Tips

### **Question Types:**

2. **Think Simple:** Don't overthink - straightforward solutions are usually correct
3. **Answer Everything:** No penalty for wrong answers, so guess if unsure
4. **Flag for Review:** Mark difficult questions to revisit later

### **Study Recommendations:**
- Focus on the ~40 core services covered in comprehensive courses
- Some services in the appendix may be "distractors" (wrong answers)
- Read AWS service overviews for deeper understanding
- Practice with official AWS Skill Builder questions (free 20-question set)
- Aim for understanding concepts, not memorizing details

**Remember:** The goal is not just to pass with 700/1000, but to truly understand AWS fundamentals for your career development!
