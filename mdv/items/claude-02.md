- **Current Infrastructure:** Single data center in Oregon
- **Primary Market:** United States (80% of traffic)
- **Growth Plans:** Expanding to Europe and Asia-Pacific
- **Website:** Online shopping platform with 50,000+ products
- **Peak Traffic:** Black Friday sees 10x normal traffic
- **Compliance:** Must meet GDPR (Europe) and data residency laws

### **Business Requirements:**
1. **Performance:** Page load times < 2 seconds globally
2. **Availability:** 99.99% uptime requirement
3. **Compliance:** European customer data must stay in EU
4. **Cost:** Minimize operational expenses while meeting goals
5. **Scalability:** Handle sudden traffic spikes automatically

---

##  **YOUR MISSION**

Design a global AWS deployment strategy that meets all business requirements. You'll make decisions about regions, availability zones, and services while considering real-world constraints.

---

##  **STEP 1: Region Selection Analysis**

Let's start with the most critical decision - which AWS regions should you choose?

### **Available Options & Considerations:**

** North America:**
- **US East (N. Virginia)** - Lowest cost, most services
- **US West (Oregon)** - Current location, established infrastructure
- **Canada (Central)** - Data sovereignty for Canadian customers

** Europe:**
- **EU West (Ireland)** - GDPR compliant, good connectivity
- **EU Central (Frankfurt)** - Heart of Europe, strict data laws
- **EU West (London)** - Post-Brexit considerations

** Asia-Pacific:**
- **Asia Pacific (Singapore)** - Regional hub, excellent connectivity
- **Asia Pacific (Tokyo)** - Large market, high performance requirements
- **Asia Pacific (Sydney)** - Growing market, data residency laws

### ** Decision Time - Which regions would you choose and why?**

**Think about:**
- Where are your customers located?
- What are the latency implications?
- Which compliance requirements must you meet?
- How do costs vary between regions?

**Recommended Regional Strategy:**

**Primary Regions (Core Services):**
1. **US West (Oregon)** - Keep existing infrastructure, West Coast users
2. **EU West (Ireland)** - GDPR compliance, serves all of Europe
3. **Asia Pacific (Singapore)** - Central location for APAC expansion

**Secondary Regions (Disaster Recovery):**
1. **US East (N. Virginia)** - Backup for US operations, cost-effective
2. **EU Central (Frankfurt)** - Backup for EU, strict data residency

**Reasoning:**
- **3 primary regions** provide global coverage with reasonable costs
- **Compliance met:** EU data stays in EU regions
- **Latency optimized:** Users connect to nearest region
- **Disaster recovery:** Each primary region has a backup pair
</details>

##  **STEP 2: Availability Zone Strategy**

Now that you've selected regions, how will you deploy across Availability Zones within each region?

### **Scenario Challenge:**
Your e-commerce platform consists of:
- **Web servers** (front-end application)
- **Application servers** (business logic)
- **Database servers** (customer data, inventory)
- **File storage** (product images, documents)

### ** Decision Time - How many AZs will you use in each region?**

**Consider:**
- What's the minimum for high availability?
- How does this affect costs?
- What happens if one AZ fails?

<details>
<summary><strong> Click to see the recommended solution</strong></summary>

**Recommended AZ Strategy:**

**Deploy across 3 Availability Zones in each region:**

**AZ Distribution:**
- **Web Tier:** Load balancer distributes traffic across all 3 AZs
- **App Tier:** Application servers in all 3 AZs for redundancy
- **Database Tier:** Primary in AZ-1, standby replicas in AZ-2 and AZ-3
- **Storage:** Automatically replicated across multiple AZs

**Benefits:**
- **Survives entire AZ failure** - 2 AZs can handle full load
- **Load distribution** - Traffic spread evenly
- **Maintenance windows** - Can take down 1 AZ without impact
- **AWS Best Practice** - Follows recommended architecture patterns

**Cost Impact:** ~20% increase vs single AZ, but worth it for availability

##  **STEP 3: Content Delivery & Performance**

Your customers in Japan are complaining about slow-loading product images. How do you solve this globally?

### **Current Problem:**
- Product images stored in US West (Oregon) S3 bucket
- Japanese customers experience 3-4 second load times for images
- European customers also reporting slow performance during peak hours

### ** Decision Time - What AWS services will you use to solve this?**

**Options to consider:**
- Store images in every region
- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Implement regional caching
- Optimize image formats

<details>
<summary><strong> Click to see the recommended solution</strong></summary>

**Recommended Solution: Amazon CloudFront CDN**

**Implementation:**
1. **CloudFront Distribution** with global edge locations
2. **Origin:** S3 bucket in US West (Oregon) - single source of truth
3. **Edge Caching:** Images cached at 400+ edge locations worldwide
4. **Smart Routing:** Users automatically connect to nearest edge location

**Performance Results:**
- **Tokyo users:** Images load from Tokyo edge location (~50ms)
- **London users:** Images load from London edge location (~30ms)
- **Cost Optimization:** Only pay for edge traffic, not origin transfers
- **Automatic Updates:** New images propagate globally within minutes

**Additional Optimizations:**
- **Image Compression:** Automatic optimization for different devices
- **HTTP/2 Support:** Faster multiplexed connections
- **SSL/TLS:** Secure delivery with AWS-managed certificates
</details>

##  **STEP 4: Traffic Surge Management**

Black Friday is approaching! Last year, traffic increased 10x and your single Oregon data center crashed. How do you prepare this year?

### **Expected Traffic Pattern:**
- **Normal:** 1,000 concurrent users
- **Black Friday:** 10,000 concurrent users (24-hour event)
- **Geography:** 60% US, 25% Europe, 15% Asia
- **Requirements:** Zero downtime, maintain performance

### ** Decision Time - How will you handle this massive traffic spike?**

**Consider:**
- How do you scale compute resources automatically?
- What about database performance?
- How do you ensure global availability?

<details>
<summary><strong> Click to see the recommended solution</strong></summary>

**Recommended Auto-Scaling Strategy:**

**1. Elastic Load Balancing + Auto Scaling Groups:**
- **Normal:** 6 web servers (2 per AZ across 3 AZs)
- **Black Friday:** Auto-scale up to 60 web servers (20 per AZ)
- **Triggers:** Scale up at 70% CPU, scale down at 30% CPU
- **Health Checks:** Automatic replacement of failed instances

**2. Database Scaling:**
- **Read Replicas:** 3 read replicas per region (9 total globally)
- **Connection Pooling:** Distribute read traffic across replicas
- **Caching:** ElastiCache for frequently accessed data

**3. Regional Failover:**
- **Primary:** Each region handles its traffic
- **Backup:** Route 53 health checks with automatic failover
- **If region fails:** Traffic redirects to nearest healthy region

**4. Cost Management:**
- **Spot Instances:** Use for non-critical background tasks
- **Reserved Instances:** Pre-purchase capacity for predictable workloads
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch alerts for cost and performance

**Expected Results:**
- **Automatic scaling:** Handle 10x traffic without manual intervention
- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for resources during high traffic
- **Global Resilience:** If one region fails, others continue serving

##  **STEP 5: Compliance & Data Governance**

A major European enterprise wants to become your customer, but they have strict GDPR requirements:

### **Requirements:**
1. **European customer data must never leave EU regions**
2. **Data processing logs must be available for audit**
3. **Right to be forgotten** - customers can request data deletion
4. **Data encryption** at rest and in transit
5. **Access controls** with detailed logging

### ** Decision Time - How do you ensure compliance while maintaining global operations?**

<details>
<summary><strong> Click to see the recommended solution</strong></summary>

**Recommended Compliance Strategy:**

**1. Data Residency:**
- **EU customers:** Data stored only in EU West (Ireland) and EU Central (Frankfurt)
- **Region Lock:** Application logic prevents EU data from leaving EU regions
- **Database Separation:** EU customer database isolated from global database

**2. Encryption & Security:**
