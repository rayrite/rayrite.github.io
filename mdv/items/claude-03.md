**Banking Industry Standards:**

**RTO Requirements:**
- **Critical Systems:** 5-15 minutes maximum
- **Customer-Facing Systems:** 1 hour maximum
- **Regulatory Reporting:** 4 hours maximum
- **Back-Office Systems:** 24 hours maximum

**RPO Requirements:**
- **Financial Transactions:** 0 seconds (zero data loss)
- **Customer Data:** 1 minute maximum
- **Audit Logs:** 0 seconds (regulatory requirement)
- **Marketing Data:** 1 hour acceptable

**Your Target:** RTO = 15 minutes, RPO = 0 seconds for critical systems
</details>

##  **STEP 1: IMMEDIATE CRISIS RESPONSE**

It's been 10 minutes since the disaster struck. Your monitoring systems are screaming red alerts, and customer complaints are flooding social media.

### **Current Status Check:**
- **Primary Region (US East):** Complete failure, ETA unknown
- **Secondary Region (US West):** Standing by, ready for activation
- **Customer Impact:** 100% of users unable to access services
- **Transaction Processing:** Completely halted
- **Data Replication Status:** Unknown - need to verify

### ** Immediate Actions Required:**

** Decision Time - What's your first priority?**

**Option A:** Immediately activate disaster recovery in US West
**Option B:** First assess data integrity and replication status
**Option C:** Contact AWS support for primary region status update
**Option D:** Communicate with customers and regulators first

<details>
<summary><strong> Click to see the recommended crisis response</strong></summary>

**Correct Priority: Option B - Assess Data Integrity First**

**Why This Is Critical:**
- **Banking Regulation:** Never activate DR without confirming data integrity
- **Financial Risk:** Inconsistent data could cause accounting discrepancies
- **Legal Protection:** Documentation of data status protects against liability
- **Customer Trust:** Ensures accurate account balances when service resumes

**Immediate Action Plan:**
1. **Verify replication lag** between primary and secondary databases
2. **Check last successful backup timestamp**
3. **Confirm transaction log integrity** in secondary region
4. **Document current state** for regulatory compliance
5. **THEN activate disaster recovery** with confidence

**Time Investment:** 5 minutes for verification vs. potentially weeks of reconciliation
</details>

##  **STEP 2: DATA INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT**

Your team has completed the data assessment. Here's what they found:

### **Database Replication Status:**
- **Customer Account Data:** Synchronized as of 2:28 PM (2 minutes ago) ✅
- **Transaction Processing:** Last transaction replicated at 2:29 PM (1 minute ago) ✅
- **Audit Logs:** Real-time streaming, current as of 2:30 PM ✅
- **Configuration Data:** Synchronized as of 2:25 PM (5 minutes ago) ⚠️
- **Pending Transactions:** 47 transactions "in-flight" at time of failure ❌

### **The Challenge:**
You have 47 transactions that were being processed when the disaster occurred. These represent $1.2 million in customer transfers and payments.

### ** Decision Time - How do you handle the in-flight transactions?**

**Consider:**
- Customer impact of lost vs. duplicate transactions
- Regulatory requirements for transaction integrity
- Technical complexity of recovery
- Time pressure to restore service

<details>
<summary><strong> Click to see the recommended approach</strong></summary>

**Recommended Transaction Recovery Strategy:**

**Step 1: Conservative Approach**
- **Mark all 47 transactions as "pending investigation"**
- **Do NOT process them automatically in DR environment**
- **Restore service WITHOUT these transactions initially**

**Step 2: Manual Reconciliation**
- **Contact affected customers within 1 hour**
- **Review transaction logs manually**
- **Process valid transactions with customer confirmation**
- **Document all decisions for audit trail**

**Why This Approach:**
- **Prevents duplicate payments** (worse than delayed payments)
- **Maintains customer trust** through transparency
- **Satisfies regulatory requirements** for transaction integrity
- **Allows immediate service restoration** for 99.99% of users

**Timeline:**
- **Service restored:** 15 minutes from now
- **Transaction reconciliation:** 2-4 hours
- **Customer communication:** Within 1 hour
</details>

##  **STEP 3: DISASTER RECOVERY ACTIVATION**

Time to activate your disaster recovery plan! Your secondary region in US West is ready, but you need to make critical decisions about the failover process.

### **Available DR Strategies:**

** Hot Standby (Active-Active)**
- **Setup:** Identical infrastructure running in both regions
- **Failover Time:** 30 seconds (DNS change only)
- **Cost:** 2x infrastructure costs
- **Data Sync:** Real-time replication

** Warm Standby (Active-Passive)**
- **Setup:** Reduced infrastructure, scaled up during failover
- **Failover Time:** 15 minutes (scale up required)
- **Cost:** 25% of full infrastructure costs
- **Data Sync:** Near real-time replication

**❄️ Cold Standby (Backup & Restore)**
- **Setup:** Data backups only, infrastructure built during disaster
- **Failover Time:** 2-4 hours (full rebuild)
- **Cost:** Storage costs only
- **Data Sync:** Scheduled backups

### **Your Current Setup:**
Based on your budget constraints, you implemented a **Warm Standby** strategy.

### ** Decision Time - Execute the failover plan:**

**What needs to happen for your warm standby activation?**
