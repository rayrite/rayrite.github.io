**Hour 3: Breach Containment**
- Isolate affected marketing automation system
- Disable unauthorized data access points
- Implement additional access controls
- Stop any ongoing data transfers

**Hour 4: Investigation Team Assembly**
- Legal counsel (outside firm specialized in securities law)
- Forensic investigators (certified in financial services)
- AWS Professional Services (for technical analysis)
- Internal compliance and risk teams

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **Option A:** Premature regulatory notification without facts could worsen situation
- **Option C:** Client notification timing is governed by specific regulatory requirements
- **Option D:** Investigation can't proceed without proper evidence preservation first

##  **STEP 1: FORENSIC INVESTIGATION USING AWS SERVICES**

Your investigation team is using AWS security and compliance services to determine the exact scope of the regulatory breach.

### **AWS-Based Investigation Approach:**

**Phase 1: Data Flow Analysis with AWS Macie****AWS Macie Investigation Results:**

Using Macie to scan all S3 buckets and data repositories:

**Sensitive Data Discovery:**
- **Client SSNs:** 12,847 instances found in marketing automation S3 bucket
- **Bank Account Numbers:** 8,234 instances in customer onboarding data
- **Investment Account IDs:** 15,679 instances in various analytics databases
- **Financial Information:** Tax ID numbers, income data, net worth records
- **Personal Information:** Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses

**Unauthorized Access Patterns:**
- **Marketing Automation System:** Had broad read access to client database
- **Third-party Integration:** Customer data being sent to external marketing vendor
- **Data Retention Violation:** Client data retained beyond policy limits
- **Geographic Transfer:** Data transferred to vendor servers outside the US

### **Phase 2: Timeline Analysis with AWS CloudTrail**

**CloudTrail Investigation Results:**

**Critical Timeline Discovery:**
- **January 15, 2024:** Marketing automation system configured with overly broad S3 permissions
- **January 20, 2024:** First unauthorized data export to external vendor (Acme Marketing Solutions)
- **March-August 2024:** Weekly automated data transfers containing client PII
- **August 12, 2024:** Internal compliance audit detected anomalous data access patterns
- **August 15, 2024:** Investigation initiated by risk management team

**Key API Calls Identified:**
```json
{
  "eventTime": "2024-01-20T10:15:00Z",
  "eventName": "GetObject",
  "userIdentity": {
    "type": "AssumedRole",
    "principalId": "AIDAABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP:marketing-automation-service",
    "arn": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/MarketingAutomationRole/marketing-automation-service"
  },
  "sourceIPAddress": "203.0.113.0",
  "resources": [
    {
      "ARN": "arn:aws:s3:::tradetechfinancial-client-data/client-profiles/sensitive-data-export.csv",
      "type": "AWS::S3::Object"
    }
  ],
  "responseElements": null,
  "requestID": "87654321-1234-5678-9012-123456789012"
}
```

### **Phase 3: Configuration Analysis with AWS Config**

**Compliance Violations Identified:**
- **IAM Overpermissioning:** Marketing role had unnecessary S3:GetObject permissions
- **Data Classification Missing:** S3 buckets not properly tagged for data sensitivity
- **Encryption Gaps:** Some client data stored without proper encryption
- **Retention Policy Violations:** Data retained beyond regulatory requirements

### ** Decision Time - Investigation Scope Determination**

Based on AWS service findings, you need to determine the exact scope for regulatory reporting. What's your approach?

**Option A:** Report only confirmed unauthorized disclosures (12,000+ clients)
**Option B:** Report all clients whose data was accessible (50,000 clients)  
**Option C:** Limit scope to material financial information only
**Option D:** Expand scope to include all potential access points

<details>
<summary><strong> Click to see the recommended scope determination approach</strong></summary>

**Recommended: Option A - Report only confirmed unauthorized disclosures**

**Regulatory Scope Analysis:**

**Confirmed Violations (Tier 1 - Must Report):**
- **12,847 clients:** Confirmed data transfers to unauthorized third party
- **Evidence:** CloudTrail logs show specific S3 GetObject calls
- **Data Types:** Names, SSNs, account numbers, investment details
- **Duration:** January 20 - August 12, 2024 (approx. 6 months)
- **Recipient:** Acme Marketing Solutions (unauthorized vendor)

**Potential Access (Tier 2 - Assess for Reporting):**
- **Additional 37,153 clients:** Data was accessible but no confirmed transfer
- **Risk Assessment:** Marketing role had permissions but no evidence of actual access
- **Regulatory Guidance:** SEC requires reporting of actual breaches, not theoretical access
- **Conservative Approach:** Monitor and assess but don't include in initial notification

**Regulatory Reporting Strategy:**
1. **Immediate SEC Notification:** 12,847 confirmed affected clients
2. **Client Notification:** Focus on confirmed breach population
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement additional controls for all client data
4. **Ongoing Assessment:** Continue investigation for potential additional violations

**Legal Rationale:**
- **Regulation S-P Requirements:** Notification required for "unauthorized acquisition of customer information"
- **Burden of Proof:** Must demonstrate actual unauthorized access, not just potential
- **Materiality Standard:** Focus on confirmed breaches that meet materiality thresholds
- **Credibility Protection:** Accurate initial reporting prevents regulatory credibility issues

**Evidence Package for Regulators:**
- **CloudTrail logs:** Specific API calls showing data access
- **Macie reports:** Data classification and sensitivity analysis
- **Config compliance:** Timeline of security control failures
- **Impact assessment:** Client-by-client analysis of data exposed
</details>
